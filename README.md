- [12 hours left], *what do we do?* </br>
- [10 hours left], Hey, (insert AI chatbot) WHAT do we do in a hackathon?


Fearing the deadline approaching quickly, we could not, for the love of god, come up with a project we all wanted to work upon. We all had one thing we wanted to do but not having a central theme made us confused. Just like us, everyone else was having similar issues with finding what to work on. Hence, we desiced to create Nobrainstrom to solve this predicement.

**Nobrainstrom** is an online whiteboard enhanced by AI analysis and automation, designed to revolutionize how one brainstorms and develop ideas to work on.

## Features

### Canvas Interface with tldraw

- **Canvas**: Engage in real-time collaboration using text, sketches, and sticky notes.
- **AI Canvas**: Automatically organizes ideas into flowcharts, Venn diagrams, or X-Y graphs to reveal trends and patterns.

### AI Guidance

- **Goal-Oriented Suggestions**: Set specific brainstorming goals (e.g., "Product Launch Strategy for a Hackathon") to focus AI-generated suggestions.
- **Real-Time Concept Generation**: The AI generates related concepts, connects ideas, and builds visual frameworks in real time.

### Image Analysis & Enhancement

- **Sketch Refinement**: Sketch images and scribbles; the AI analyzes content and refines or iterates via DALL-E integration.

### Graphing

- **JSON-Based Visualization**:
  - AI creates JSON values representing X and Y coordinates for 2-3 graphs comparing key brainstorming elements.
  - Contextual pairing and ranking for 2D graph plotting.
  - Frontend utilizes this data to draft charts using a JavaScript library.

### Features we want to add in the future:

### Voice-to-Text

- **Live Idea Capture**: Capture spoken ideas during live sessions.

### Instant Visualizations

- **Automated Structuring**: Convert unstructured input into mind maps, timelines, or hierarchical charts automatically.

### Flowcharts

  - AI will identify flows/patterns in brainstorming sessions and generates flow diagrams.
  - Flowcharts can be provided provided, which the frontend converts into visual representations.
